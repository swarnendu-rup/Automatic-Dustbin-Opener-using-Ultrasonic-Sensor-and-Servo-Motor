# Automatic-Dustbin-Opener-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Servo-Motor
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a personâ€™s hand is near the dustbin. If the distance is less than 50 cm, a servo motor opens the lid automatically, waits for a few seconds, and then closes it. Useful for contactless waste disposal.
